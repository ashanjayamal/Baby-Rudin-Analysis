# The Real and Complex Number Systems

## Exercise

```{exercise}
If $r$ is rational $r\neq 0$ and x is irrational, prove that $r + x$ and $rx$ are irrational.
```
Suppose that  $0 \neq r \in \mathbb{Q}$ and $x\in \mathbb{R}\setminus \mathbb{Q}$

- **Claim 1**: $r+x$ is irrational.\
Assume the contray that $r+x\in \mathbb{Q}$. Since, $\mathbb{Q}$ is field,
\[x=(r+x)-r\in \mathbb{Q}\]. This is a contradiction. Thus, $r+x$ is contradiction.

- **Claim 2**: $rx$ is irrational.\
Assume the contray that $rx\in \mathbb{Q}$. Since, $\mathbb{Q}$ is field,
\[\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)rx=\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)xr=\left(\frac{1}{x}x\right)r=x\in \mathbb{Q}\]. This is a contradiction. Thus, $r+x$ is contradiction.

```{exercise,name="1:R2"}
Prove that there is no rational number whose square is 12.
```

```{proof}
First observe that 
\[\sqrt{12}=\sqrt{4\cdot 3}=2\sqrt{3}\]

**Claim 1** : $\forall n\in \mathbb{N}3|n^2 \implies 3|n$.\
Let $n\in \mathbb{N}$. Suppose that $3|n^2$ We know that $3$ is prime. Then by number theory resuts we can get $3|n$ or $3|n$.
We are done.

**Cliam 2**: $\sqrt{3}$ is irrartional.\
We use inderect proof. Assume contary, $\sqrt{3}$ is rational. In other words,
\[\sqrt{3}=\frac{p}{q}\text{  for some } q\in \mathbb{Z} , q\neq 0\text{ and } p,q \text{ have no comman factors.}\]
Thus,\[3q^2=p^2\]
Then, by above claim we can get that $3|p$. Thus, there exists $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $3k=p$. 
Thus, 
$$
\begin{aligned}
3q^2 &=p^2\\
3q^2 &= (3k)^2\\
3q^2 &= 9k^2\\
q^2  &= 3k^2
\end{aligned}
$$
So, both $p$ and $q$ have comman factor 3.This contract our assumption. Thefore, $\sqrt(3)$ is irrational. So we are done proof of claim 2.

Since, $\sqrt{3}$ is not a rational number. Thus $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational number.

```{exercise}
Prove Proposition 1.15.
```

```{exercise}
Let \( E \) be a nonempty subset of an ordered set. Suppose \( \alpha \) is a lower bound of \( E \) and \( \beta \) is an upper bound of \( E \). Prove that \( \alpha \leq \beta \).
```


Let $\emptyset \neq E$ is sub set of ordered set.
