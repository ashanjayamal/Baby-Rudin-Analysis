[["index.html", "Baby Rudin Chapter 1 The Real and Complex Number Systems 1.1 Exercise", " Baby Rudin Ashan Jayamal 2024-09-11 Chapter 1 The Real and Complex Number Systems 1.1 Exercise Exercise 1.1 If \\(r\\) is rational \\(r\\neq 0\\) and x is irrational, prove that \\(r + x\\) and \\(rx\\) are irrational. Suppose that \\(0 \\neq r \\in \\mathbb{Q}\\) and \\(x\\in \\mathbb{R}\\setminus \\mathbb{Q}\\) Claim 1: \\(r+x\\) is irrational. Assume the contray that \\(r+x\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Since, \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is field, \\[x=(r+x)-r\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\]. This is a contradiction. Thus, \\(r+x\\) is contradiction. Claim 2: \\(rx\\) is irrational. Assume the contray that \\(rx\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\). Since, \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) is field, \\[\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)rx=\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)xr=\\left(\\frac{1}{x}x\\right)r=x\\in \\mathbb{Q}\\]. This is a contradiction. Thus, \\(r+x\\) is contradiction. Exercise 1.2 (1:R2) Prove that there is no rational number whose square is 12. Proof. First observe that \\[\\sqrt{12}=\\sqrt{4\\cdot 3}=2\\sqrt{3}\\] Claim 1 : \\(\\forall n\\in \\mathbb{N}3|n^2 \\implies 3|n\\). Let \\(n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\). Suppose that \\(3|n^2\\) We know that \\(3\\) is prime. Then by number theory resuts we can get \\(3|n\\) or \\(3|n\\). We are done. Cliam 2: \\(|sqrt{3}\\) is irrartional. We use inderect proof. Assume contary, \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is rational. In other words, \\[\\sqrt{3}=\\frac{p}{q}\\text{ for some } q\\in \\mathbb{Z} , q\\neq 0\\text{ and } p,q \\text{ have no comman factors.}\\] Thus,\\[3q^2=p^2\\] Then, by above claim we can get that \\(3|p\\). Thus, there exists \\(k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) such that \\(3k=p\\). Thus, \\[ \\begin{aligned} 3q^2 &amp;=p^2\\\\ 3q^2 &amp;= (3k)^2\\\\ 3q^2 &amp;= 9k^2\\\\ q^2 &amp;= 3k^2 \\end{aligned} \\] So, both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) have comman factor 3.This contract our assumption. Thefore, \\(\\sqrt(3)\\) is irrational. So we are done proof of claim 2. Since \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) is not a Exercise 1.3 Let \\(E\\) be a nonempty subset of an ordered set. Suppose \\(\\alpha\\) is a lower bound of \\(E\\) and \\(\\beta\\) is an upper bound of \\(E\\). Prove that \\(\\alpha \\leq \\beta\\). Let \\(\\emptyset \\neq E\\) is sub set of ordered set.
